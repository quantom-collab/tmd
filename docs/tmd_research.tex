\section{Introduction}
This document aims to provide a detailed understanding of Transverse Momentum Distributions (TMDs), their theoretical underpinnings in Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD), their relevance in processes like Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS), and the associated formalism.

\section{Foundational Understanding and SIDIS}

\subsection{Feynman Diagrams for TMDs in SIDIS}

\subsubsection{Identifying Key Feynman Diagrams for SIDIS}

Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS), where a lepton scatters off a nucleon and a specific hadron is detected in the final state (e.g.,
$e + N \rightarrow e' + h + X$), is a crucial process for studying the internal structure of hadrons, including their Transverse Momentum
Distributions (TMDs). The fundamental interaction at the parton level is the scattering of the virtual photon (emitted by the lepton) off a quark (or
antiquark) within the nucleon. This struck quark then fragments into the observed hadron $h$.

The most basic Feynman diagram representing this process at the lowest order in perturbative QCD is often referred to as the ``handbag diagram.''
This diagram depicts the lepton emitting a virtual photon, which is then absorbed by a quark inside the target nucleon. The scattered quark
subsequently fragments into the detected hadron.

However, to understand TMDs, we need to go beyond this simple picture and consider the transverse momentum of the partons. TMDs account for the
intrinsic transverse momentum of quarks and gluons confined within the nucleon, as well as the transverse momentum generated during the fragmentation
process. The Feynman diagrams relevant for a TMD description of SIDIS incorporate these aspects and involve more complex QCD interactions.

Specifically, the diagrams that contribute to the definition and evolution of TMDs include those with gluon emissions and absorptions by the active
parton (the quark being struck or the quark fragmenting). These gluon exchanges are crucial for understanding the gauge-invariant definition of TMDs,
which requires the inclusion of Wilson lines (gauge links). These Wilson lines represent the resummation of soft and collinear gluon interactions
between the active parton and the remnants of the nucleon or the other products of fragmentation.

In the context of TMD factorization for SIDIS at low transverse momentum of the produced hadron ($P_{hT}$), the process can be visualized as:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A virtual photon interacts with a quark inside the nucleon. This quark possesses not only a longitudinal momentum fraction $x$ but also an intrinsic
        transverse momentum $k_T$ relative to the nucleon's direction. This is described by a TMD Parton Distribution Function (TMD PDF).
  \item The struck quark, after interacting with the photon, fragments into the observed hadron. During this fragmentation process, a transverse momentum
        $p_T$ (relative to the fragmenting quark's direction) can be generated. This is described by a TMD Fragmentation Function (TMD FF).
\end{enumerate}

Diagrammatically, one considers the hard scattering part (photon-quark interaction) and connects it to non-perturbative TMD correlators. These
correlators are represented by quark (or gluon) fields separated by a light-like distance and connected by gauge links. The gauge links are
path-ordered exponentials of the gluon field and are essential to ensure gauge invariance. Their specific path depends on the process and the color
flow. For SIDIS, the gauge links for TMD PDFs typically involve future-pointing and/or past-pointing staples, reflecting the initial and final state
interactions of the struck quark with the target remnants.

\subsubsection{Role of Feynman Diagrams in Understanding TMDs in SIDIS}

The Feynman diagrams in the context of TMDs and SIDIS serve multiple crucial roles:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Visualizing the Interaction:} At the most basic level, they provide a visual representation of the scattering process. The handbag diagram shows the lepton-quark interaction mediated by a virtual photon and the subsequent fragmentation. More complex diagrams illustrate gluon radiation and absorption, which are fundamental to understanding the transverse momentum of partons.
  \item \textbf{Defining TMD Correlators:} The operator definition of TMDs involves quark and gluon fields separated by a certain distance and connected by gauge links. Feynman diagrams help in understanding how these non-local operators arise from summing up classes of diagrams involving soft and collinear gluon exchanges. The structure of the gauge link (e.g., its path in spacetime) is dictated by the process and can be derived by analyzing the relevant Feynman diagrams that contribute to the leading power behavior of the cross-section in the TMD regime.
  \item \textbf{Calculating Perturbative Components:} While TMDs themselves are non-perturbative objects that describe the long-distance structure of hadrons, their evolution with energy scales (like $Q^2$ or the TMD scale $\zeta$) and their matching onto collinear parton distributions at high transverse momentum can be calculated perturbatively. Feynman diagrams are the primary tool for performing these perturbative QCD calculations. For instance, calculating the TMD evolution kernels (like the Collins-Soper kernel) or the perturbative coefficients in TMD factorization theorems involves evaluating loop diagrams and real emission diagrams.
  \item \textbf{Understanding Factorization:} TMD factorization theorems state that, under certain kinematic conditions (typically when the observed transverse momentum is much smaller than the hard scale $Q$), the SIDIS cross-section can be written as a convolution of hard scattering parts (calculable in perturbation theory), TMD PDFs, and TMD FFs. The proof and understanding of these factorization theorems rely heavily on analyzing the singularity structure of Feynman diagrams in various momentum regions (hard, collinear, soft). The diagrams help identify which contributions factorize into universal TMDs and which belong to the hard process-dependent part.
  \item \textbf{Illustrating Gauge Invariance:} The need for gauge links in the definition of TMDs becomes clear when considering Feynman diagrams in a gauge theory like QCD. Without appropriate gauge links, the matrix elements defining TMDs would not be gauge invariant. The diagrams show how gluon attachments to the quark lines, when resummed, lead to these path-ordered exponentials of the gluon field.
\end{enumerate}

In essence, Feynman diagrams provide the bridge between the abstract operator definitions of TMDs and their phenomenological application in
describing experimental observables like SIDIS. They are indispensable for deriving the theoretical framework of TMDs, including their definitions,
evolution equations, and factorization properties.

\subsection{Definition and Origin of TMDs}

\subsubsection{Detailed Definition of Transverse Momentum Distributions (TMDs)}

Transverse Momentum Distributions (TMDs), also known as unintegrated parton distribution functions (uPDFs) when referring to the initial state, are
fundamental quantities in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) that describe the three-dimensional momentum structure of partons (quarks and gluons) inside a
hadron. Unlike the more familiar collinear Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs), which describe the probability of finding a parton carrying a
certain longitudinal momentum fraction $x$ of the parent hadron (integrated over all transverse momenta), TMDs provide additional information about
the parton's transverse momentum $k_T$ relative to the direction of the parent hadron.

A generic TMD PDF, denoted as $f(x, k_T^2, \mu, \zeta)$, depends on:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $x$: The longitudinal momentum fraction of the parton relative to the hadron.
  \item $k_T^2$: The square of the parton's transverse momentum.
  \item $\mu$: The renormalization scale, or factorization scale, typically related to the hard scale of the process (e.g., $Q^2$ in DIS).
  \item $\zeta$ (or $\mu_T$ or $b_T$ in Fourier conjugate space): The TMD evolution scale, also known as the Collins-Soper scale or rapidity scale. This scale is related to the energy dependence of the TMD that is not captured by the standard DGLAP evolution associated with $\mu$.
\end{itemize}

The formal definition of a quark TMD PDF, for example, involves a non-local matrix element of quark fields within the hadron state. For an
unpolarized quark in an unpolarized hadron, the relevant correlator $\Phi_q(x, k_T)$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \Phi_q(x, k_T; n, S) = \int \frac{d\xi^{-} d^2\xi_T}{2(2\pi)^3} e^{i x P^{+} \xi^{-} - i k_T \cdot \xi_T} \langle P,S| \bar{\psi}_q(0) W(0, \xi) \gamma^{+} \psi_q(\xi) |P,S\rangle \Big|_{\xi^{+}=0}
  \label{eq:tmd_definition}
\end{equation}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $|P,S\rangle$ represents the hadron state with momentum $P$ and spin $S$.
  \item $\psi_q(\xi)$ and $\bar{\psi}_q(0)$ are quark field operators at spacetime positions $\xi$ and $0$, respectively.
  \item $\gamma^{+}$ is a Dirac gamma matrix projecting onto the ``good'' light-cone components.
  \item $P^{+}$ is the large light-cone momentum component of the hadron.
  \item $\xi = (\xi^{+}, \xi^{-}, \xi_T)$ is the spacetime separation vector, with $\xi^{+}=0$ meaning the fields are separated at equal light-cone time.
  \item $W(0, \xi)$ is a Wilson line (or gauge link) connecting the points $0$ and $\xi$. This is a path-ordered exponential of the gluon field, $W = \mathcal{P} \exp(-ig \int A\cdot dl)$, ensuring the gauge invariance of the definition. The precise path of the Wilson line depends on the process being considered (e.g., Drell-Yan vs. SIDIS) due to initial/final state interactions. For SIDIS TMD PDFs, the gauge link typically includes a staple extending to light-cone infinity in the direction opposite to the hadron's motion, representing final-state interactions of the struck quark.
\end{itemize}

This correlator can be decomposed into various TMD functions depending on the polarization of the quark and the hadron. For instance, $f_1(x, k_T^2)$
is the unpolarized TMD PDF, while functions like $g_{1L}(x, k_T^2)$ (helicity TMD) or $h_1^{\perp}(x, k_T^2)$ (Sivers function, correlating hadron
spin with parton transverse momentum) describe spin-dependent effects.

Similarly, TMD Fragmentation Functions (TMD FFs), denoted $D(z, p_T^2, \mu, \zeta)$, describe the probability for a parton to fragment into a
specific hadron with longitudinal momentum fraction $z$ (relative to the parent parton) and transverse momentum $p_T$ (relative to the fragmenting
parton's direction). Their definition also involves non-local matrix elements of quark/gluon fields, but this time describing the hadronization
process, and includes appropriate gauge links.

\subsubsection{Origin of TMDs in the Theoretical Framework of QCD}

TMDs arise naturally within QCD when one considers processes where the transverse momentum of partons plays a significant role and is not integrated
over. Their origin can be understood from several perspectives:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Intrinsic Parton Motion:} Partons inside a hadron are not static point particles moving collinearly with the hadron. Due to their confinement within a finite volume (approximately 1 femtometer), the Heisenberg uncertainty principle implies that they must possess some intrinsic transverse momentum. This is a non-perturbative effect inherent to the bound-state nature of hadrons.
  \item \textbf{QCD Dynamics and Radiative Effects:} Even if one were to imagine a parton with zero intrinsic transverse momentum at some low scale, QCD interactions, particularly gluon radiation, would generate transverse momentum. When a quark emits a gluon, both the quark and the gluon acquire transverse momentum. The resummation of soft and collinear gluon emissions is a key aspect of TMD physics and contributes to their scale dependence (evolution).
  \item \textbf{Factorization of Cross Sections:} In high-energy scattering processes like SIDIS or Drell-Yan production at low transverse momentum of the final state system (e.g., the produced hadron pair or lepton pair), QCD factorization theorems are developed to separate the short-distance (hard) part of the interaction from the long-distance (soft/collinear) parts. When the transverse momentum $q_T$ of the observed system is much smaller than the hard scale $Q$ (i.e., $q_T \ll Q$), the factorization involves TMDs. The derivation of these factorization theorems from first principles in QCD, by analyzing the singular behavior of Feynman diagrams, shows that the cross-sections can be expressed in terms of these TMD objects. The gauge links in the TMD definition are a direct consequence of ensuring that these factorized long-distance parts are process-independent (universal, up to calculable process-dependent Wilson lines) and gauge invariant.
  \item \textbf{Operator Product Expansion (OPE) in a Non-Collinear Regime:} While collinear PDFs are related to light-cone operators in the OPE, TMDs can be seen as a generalization that retains information about transverse momentum. They are defined via matrix elements of bilocal quark or gluon operators separated by a light-like distance but also allowing for transverse separation, Fourier transformed with respect to this transverse separation.
\end{enumerate}

In summary, TMDs originate from the fundamental quantum and relativistic nature of partons confined within hadrons, combined with the dynamics of QCD
interactions (gluon radiation and absorption). They are formally defined through gauge-invariant non-local matrix elements within the framework of
QCD and emerge as essential components in the factorization of hadronic cross sections in specific kinematic regimes where transverse momentum
effects are prominent.

\subsubsection{Clarifying the Two Scales in TMDs: The Hard Scale ($\mu$) and the TMD Scale ($\zeta$)}

Transverse Momentum Distributions (TMDs) are characterized by their dependence on two distinct types of scales, which is a crucial feature
distinguishing them from collinear Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) that depend on a single factorization/renormalization scale $\mu$.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{The Renormalization/Factorization Scale ($\mu$):} This scale is analogous to the scale found in collinear PDFs and is typically related to the hard scale of the process in which the TMD is being probed. For example, in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) or SIDIS, $\mu$ is often chosen to be of the order of $Q$, the virtuality of the photon. This scale arises from the renormalization of ultraviolet (UV) divergences that appear in the perturbative calculations of quantities involving TMDs. The dependence of TMDs on $\mu$ is governed by evolution equations that are similar in spirit to the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations for collinear PDFs, but they also include terms specific to the TMD nature. This evolution resums logarithms of $\mu^2/k_T^2$ or $\mu^2/\Lambda_{QCD}^2$.
  \item \textbf{The TMD Evolution Scale ($\zeta$ or related variables like $\mu_T$, $b_T$, or rapidity parameter $\eta$):} This second scale is unique to TMDs and is essential for regulating and resumming a different class of divergences known as rapidity divergences or light-cone divergences. These divergences appear in the definition of TMDs due to the presence of light-like Wilson lines extending to infinity. They are not UV or purely collinear divergences but are associated with the energy sharing between collinear and soft gluon emissions that contribute to the transverse momentum.

        The TMD scale $\zeta$ (often expressed as $\zeta = M_h^2 Q^2 / (x P^+)^2$ or related to a cutoff in rapidity space) effectively separates
        contributions from different rapidity regions. The evolution of TMDs with respect to $\zeta$ is governed by the Collins-Soper (CS) equation. This
        equation resums large logarithms of $Q^2/k_T^2$ (or more precisely, logarithms involving the ratio of the hard scale to the transverse momentum
        scale, which can also be seen as logarithms of large rapidity differences). The CS equation describes how the shape of the TMD in $k_T$ changes as
        the energy of the process (related to $Q$) changes, even if $k_T$ itself is small.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Why are two scales necessary?}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Regulating Different Divergences:} Collinear PDFs are defined by integrating over all transverse momenta, which effectively smears out the issues related to soft gluon radiation that become problematic when $k_T$ is explicitly considered. The light-like Wilson lines in their definition, necessary for gauge invariance, introduce rapidity divergences when one calculates loop corrections. These are distinct from the UV divergences handled by the $\mu$ scale. The $\zeta$ scale (or its equivalent) is introduced to regulate these rapidity divergences.
  \item \textbf{Resumming Large Logarithms:} In processes where $Q^2 \gg k_T^2$, large logarithms of $Q^2/k_T^2$ appear in perturbative calculations. These logarithms can spoil the convergence of the perturbative series. The TMD evolution formalism, particularly the CS equation for $\zeta$-evolution and the DGLAP-like evolution for $\mu$-evolution, allows for the resummation of these large logarithms to all orders in perturbation theory, leading to more reliable predictions.
  \item \textbf{Factorization Requirements:} The TMD factorization theorems, which separate the SIDIS (or Drell-Yan) cross-section into a hard part and TMDs, require a consistent framework to handle all types of divergences. The two-scale formalism provides this consistency. The hard part depends on $Q$ and $\mu$, while the TMDs depend on $x, k_T, \mu,$ and $\zeta$. The dependence on $\mu$ and $\zeta$ in the TMDs cancels the corresponding dependence in the hard part and the soft factor (if not absorbed into the TMD definition), ensuring that the physical cross-section is independent of these unphysical scales.
  \item \textbf{Connecting to Collinear Factorization:} At large transverse momentum ($k_T \sim Q$), TMD factorization should smoothly match onto collinear factorization. The $\mu$ evolution plays a role here, but the $\zeta$ evolution and the structure of TMDs at large $k_T$ (where they can be expressed as a convolution of a perturbative coefficient and a collinear PDF) are also crucial for this matching. The Operator Product Expansion (OPE) can be used to show that for $k_T \gg \Lambda_{QCD}$, a TMD can be related to collinear PDFs via a perturbatively calculable coefficient function. This region is governed by DGLAP-like evolution.
\end{itemize}

In practice, TMDs are often defined in transverse position space ($b_T$-space), which is the Fourier conjugate to $k_T$-space. In $b_T$-space, the
Collins-Soper equation takes a simpler (multiplicative) form. The $b_T$ variable acts as a probe of the transverse separation, and the evolution in
$\zeta$ (or $Q$) describes how the $b_T$ distribution changes.

In summary, the two scales $\mu$ and $\zeta$ in TMDs reflect the need to handle different types of divergences (UV/collinear vs. rapidity) and to
resum different classes of large logarithms that appear when describing processes sensitive to parton transverse momentum. This two-scale structure
is a hallmark of TMD physics and is essential for the consistency and predictive power of TMD factorization.

\subsection{Relating TMD Definition to the SIDIS Process}

\subsubsection{Connecting TMD Definitions to the Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS) Process}

The formal definitions of Transverse Momentum Distributions (TMDs) as gauge-invariant, non-local matrix elements of quark and gluon fields are
directly connected to the experimental process of Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS) through the framework of TMD factorization. SIDIS,
where a lepton scatters off a nucleon and a specific hadron is detected in the final state ($e + N \rightarrow e' + h + X$), provides a key
experimental avenue to probe and extract TMDs.

\textbf{TMD Factorization in SIDIS}

In the kinematic regime where the transverse momentum of the produced hadron $P_{hT}$ (or, more precisely, the transverse momentum $q_T$ of the
virtual photon-hadron system, where $q_T = P_{hT}/z$ at leading order, with $z$ being the hadron's momentum fraction) is much smaller than the hard
scale $Q$ (the virtuality of the photon, i.e., $q_T^2 \ll Q^2$), the SIDIS cross-section can be factorized. This TMD factorization theorem states
that the cross-section can be expressed as a convolution of a hard scattering part (calculable in perturbative QCD) and non-perturbative TMDs (both
TMD Parton Distribution Functions for the initial nucleon and TMD Fragmentation Functions for the produced hadron).

The generic structure of the SIDIS cross-section in the TMD regime looks like:
\begin{align}
  \frac{d\sigma}{dx_B dQ^2 dz_h d^2P_{hT}} \approx H(Q^2, \mu) \sum_q e_q^2 \int d^2k_T d^2p_T \delta^2(z_h k_T + p_T - P_{hT})
  \
  f_{q/N}(x_B, k_T^2; \mu, \zeta_F) D_{h/q}(z_h, p_T^2; \mu, \zeta_D) + Y\text{-term}
  \label{eq:sidis_factorization}
\end{align}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $H(Q^2, \mu)$ is the hard scattering factor, representing the lepton-quark scattering at the lowest order (virtual photon exchange). It is calculable perturbatively and depends on the hard scale $Q$ and the renormalization scale $\mu$.
  \item $e_q$ is the electric charge of the quark of flavor $q$.
  \item $f_{q/N}(x_B, k_T^2; \mu, \zeta_F)$ is the TMD PDF for finding a quark $q$ inside the nucleon $N$ with longitudinal momentum fraction $x_B$ (Bjorken-x) and transverse momentum $k_T$. It depends on the scales $\mu$ and $\zeta_F$ (the TMD evolution scale for the PDF).
  \item $D_{h/q}(z_h, p_T^2; \mu, \zeta_D)$ is the TMD FF for a quark $q$ to fragment into a hadron $h$ with longitudinal momentum fraction $z_h$ (relative to the quark) and transverse momentum $p_T$ (relative to the fragmenting quark's direction). It depends on $\mu$ and $\zeta_D$ (the TMD evolution scale for the FF).
  \item The delta function $\delta^2(z_h k_T + p_T - P_{hT})$ enforces the transverse momentum conservation: the observed hadron's transverse momentum
        $P_{hT}$ results from the quark's intrinsic transverse momentum $k_T$ (scaled by $z_h$) and the transverse momentum $p_T$ generated during
        fragmentation.
  \item The $Y\text{-term}$ represents corrections that become important at larger $q_T$ and ensures a smooth matching to collinear factorization regimes. It
        is often suppressed at very low $q_T$.
  \item The sum is over all active quark and antiquark flavors.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The Role of Gauge Links in SIDIS TMDs}

The specific structure of the Wilson lines (gauge links) in the operator definition of $f_{q/N}$ and $D_{h/q}$ is crucial and process-dependent. For
SIDIS TMD PDFs, the gauge link typically involves a staple extending to light-cone infinity along a path that accounts for the final-state
interactions between the struck quark and the target remnants. These final-state interactions are responsible for time-reversal odd TMDs, such as the
Sivers function (which describes a correlation between the nucleon's transverse spin and the quark's transverse momentum) and the Boer-Mulders
function (correlating quark transverse spin and transverse momentum in an unpolarized nucleon).

For TMD FFs in SIDIS, the gauge link structure accounts for the initial-state interactions of the fragmenting quark (which was produced in the hard
scattering) before it hadronizes. This can lead to T-odd TMD FFs like the Collins function (correlating the fragmenting quark's transverse spin with
the produced hadron's transverse momentum relative to the quark).

\textbf{Extracting TMDs from SIDIS Observables}

By measuring various azimuthal asymmetries in the SIDIS cross-section, one can access different TMDs. The cross-section can be written more generally
as a sum of structure functions, each multiplied by a specific azimuthal angular dependence (e.g., $\cos(\phi_h - \phi_S)$, $\sin(\phi_h - \phi_S)$,
$\cos(2\phi_h)$, etc., where $\phi_h$ is the azimuthal angle of the produced hadron and $\phi_S$ is the azimuthal angle of the nucleon's spin
vector). Each of these structure functions is a convolution of different TMD PDFs and TMD FFs.

For example:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The unpolarized cross-section is primarily sensitive to the unpolarized TMD PDF $f_1$ and the unpolarized TMD FF $D_1$.
  \item A $\sin(\phi_h - \phi_S)$ asymmetry in the scattering of a transversely polarized nucleon is proportional to the convolution of the Sivers TMD PDF
        $h_1^{\perp}$ and the unpolarized TMD FF $D_1$.
  \item A $\sin(\phi_h + \phi_S)$ asymmetry (Collins asymmetry) when the nucleon is transversely polarized is proportional to the convolution of the
        transversity TMD PDF $h_1$ and the Collins TMD FF $H_1^{\perp}$.
\end{itemize}

By performing global fits to SIDIS data (along with data from other processes like Drell-Yan and $e^+e^-$ annihilation), phenomenologists can extract
these non-perturbative TMD functions. The evolution equations (Collins-Soper for $\zeta$ and DGLAP-like for $\mu$) are essential for relating TMDs
measured at different scales and in different experiments.

Thus, the formal operator definitions of TMDs, including their specific gauge link structures, provide the theoretical basis for interpreting SIDIS
measurements. The factorization theorem allows us to connect these fundamental QCD quantities to observable cross-sections and asymmetries, enabling
the experimental study of the 3D momentum structure of hadrons.

\subsection{TMD Evolution Equations}

\subsubsection{Necessity and Origin of TMD Evolution Equations}

Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs) are not static quantities but evolve with
the energy scales involved in the scattering process. This evolution is a fundamental consequence of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and is essential
for making precise predictions and for relating measurements made at different energy scales. The necessity for TMD evolution equations arises from
several key aspects of QCD and the definition of TMDs:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Scale Dependence of Quantum Field Theories:} In any quantum field theory, including QCD, physical observables should be independent of unphysical regularization and renormalization scales introduced to handle divergences in calculations. However, the calculated quantities that are not themselves direct physical observables, like PDFs or TMDs, do depend on these scales. Evolution equations describe how these quantities change as the scales are varied, ensuring that the scale dependence cancels out in the calculation of physical cross-sections.
  \item \textbf{Resummation of Large Logarithms:} Perturbative QCD calculations for processes involving TMDs often generate large logarithms of ratios of scales. For example, in SIDIS, if the hard scale $Q$ is much larger than the typical transverse momentum $k_T$ (i.e., $Q^2 \gg k_T^2$), logarithms like $\ln(Q^2/k_T^2)$ appear. These logarithms can be large and spoil the convergence of fixed-order perturbative expansions. TMD evolution equations, such as the Collins-Soper (CS) equation and DGLAP-like equations, resum these large logarithms to all orders in the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$, leading to more reliable theoretical predictions.
  \item \textbf{Rapidity Divergences and Wilson Lines:} As discussed earlier, TMDs are defined with light-like Wilson lines to ensure gauge invariance. These Wilson lines, extending to infinity, introduce special types of divergences called rapidity divergences (or light-cone divergences) when loop corrections are calculated. These are not standard ultraviolet (UV) or collinear divergences. The TMD evolution scale $\zeta$ (or related variables like the Collins-Soper parameter) is introduced to regulate these rapidity divergences. The evolution with respect to $\zeta$ (governed by the CS equation) specifically addresses these rapidity logarithms.
  \item \textbf{Universality and Factorization:} TMD factorization theorems, which allow us to write cross-sections as convolutions of hard parts and universal TMDs, rely on a consistent framework for handling all scale dependencies. The evolution equations ensure that the TMDs extracted from one process at a certain set of scales can be evolved and used to predict another process at different scales, thus preserving the universality of TMDs.
\end{enumerate}

In essence, the origin of TMD evolution equations lies in the need to systematically account for radiative corrections (gluon emissions and
absorptions) that modify the parton distributions as a function of the probing scales. These corrections lead to the running of the strong coupling
$\alpha_s$ and the scale dependence of the TMDs themselves.

\subsubsection{Key Features of TMD Evolution Equations (e.g., Collins-Soper Equation)}

The evolution of TMDs is governed by a set of coupled equations, primarily:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Collins-Soper (CS) Equation:} This equation describes the evolution of TMDs with respect to the TMD scale $\zeta$ (or the Collins-Soper evolution parameter, which is related to the rapidity difference between the hadron and the hard interaction). The CS equation is typically written for TMDs in transverse position space ($b_T$-space, the Fourier conjugate of $k_T$-space), where $b_T$ represents the transverse separation between the quark fields in the TMD definition.
        The CS equation has the form:
        \begin{equation}
          \frac{d \ln f(x, b_T; \mu, \zeta)}{d \ln \sqrt{\zeta}} = K(b_T; \mu)
          \label{eq:cs_equation}
        \end{equation}
        Where $f(x, b_T; \mu, \zeta)$ is the TMD in $b_T$-space, and $K(b_T; \mu)$ is the Collins-Soper evolution kernel. This kernel is perturbatively calculable. At small $b_T$ (corresponding to large $k_T$), $K(b_T; \mu)$ can be computed in powers of $\alpha_s(\mu)$. At large $b_T$ (small $k_T$), the kernel becomes non-perturbative and needs to be modeled or fitted from data. The CS equation resums logarithms of $\zeta$ (or $Q^2 b_T^2$).

  \item \textbf{Renormalization Group Equations for $\mu$-dependence:} TMDs also depend on the renormalization/factorization scale $\mu$, similar to collinear PDFs. This $\mu$-evolution is governed by DGLAP-like equations, but with modifications due to the TMD nature. The evolution equation for the $\mu$-dependence can be written as:
        \begin{equation}
          \frac{d \ln f(x, b_T; \mu, \zeta)}{d \ln \mu} = \gamma_F(\mu, \zeta/\mu^2)
          \label{eq:mu_evolution}
        \end{equation}
        Where $\gamma_F$ is an anomalous dimension. This anomalous dimension itself depends on $\alpha_s(\mu)$ and potentially on the ratio $\zeta/\mu^2$. This part of the evolution resums logarithms of $\mu^2/k_T^2$ (or $\mu^2 b_T^2$).
\end{enumerate}

The combined evolution in $\mu$ and $\zeta$ allows TMDs to be related across different hard scales $Q$ and different intrinsic transverse momentum
scales. The solution to these evolution equations involves an exponential factor (the Sudakov factor) that resums the large logarithms. This Sudakov
factor suppresses TMDs at very large $b_T$ (very small $k_T$) if $Q$ is large, reflecting the fact that it is difficult for a parton to remain at
very low transverse momentum when subjected to a very hard probe due to increased radiation.

The TMD evolution framework is crucial for phenomenological applications, allowing for consistent analysis of data from different experiments and
kinematic regions. It forms a cornerstone of precision QCD studies involving transverse momentum.

\subsection{Factorization in Processes Involving TMDs}

\subsubsection{The Concept of TMD Factorization}

TMD factorization is a fundamental concept in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) that allows for a systematic separation of short-distance (hard,
perturbative) physics from long-distance (soft/collinear, non-perturbative) physics in high-energy scattering processes where the transverse momentum
of partons is explicitly resolved and is relatively small compared to the hard interaction scale. It asserts that the cross-section for such
processes can be written as a convolution of a process-dependent hard scattering part, calculable in perturbative QCD, and process-independent (or
universal, up to well-defined process-dependent Wilson lines) Transverse Momentum Distributions (TMDs). These TMDs encapsulate the non-perturbative
information about the three-dimensional momentum structure of partons within hadrons (TMD PDFs) or about the hadronization of partons into observed
hadrons (TMD FFs).

The essence of factorization is to isolate the parts of the interaction that occur at different spacetime scales. The hard part involves large
momentum transfers (characterized by a hard scale $Q$) and occurs over short distances. The TMDs describe the physics at longer distance scales,
related to the confinement of partons and their intrinsic motion, characterized by transverse momenta $k_T$ and the hadron mass scale
$\Lambda_{QCD}$.

\subsubsection{Conditions Under Which TMD Factorization is Expected to Apply}

TMD factorization is not universally applicable to all processes or all kinematic regimes. Its validity relies on specific conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Presence of at Least Two Well-Separated Scales:} The most crucial condition is the existence of a hard scale $Q$ (e.g., the virtuality of the photon in DIS/SIDIS, or the mass of the lepton pair in Drell-Yan) and a smaller transverse momentum scale $q_T$ (e.g., the transverse momentum of the produced hadron system in SIDIS, or the lepton pair in Drell-Yan), such that $q_T^2 \ll Q^2$. This hierarchy of scales is what allows for the separation of dynamics.
  \item \textbf{Leading Power Approximation:} TMD factorization theorems are typically proven at the leading power in $q_T/Q$. Corrections to the factorization formula are suppressed by powers of $(q_T/Q)^n$.
  \item \textbf{Structure of Interactions:} The process must be such that the long-distance interactions (soft and collinear gluon exchanges) can be systematically disentangled from the hard interaction and absorbed into the definition of universal TMDs. This involves demonstrating that interactions that could spoil universality (e.g., those connecting partons from different hadrons in a way that is not simply resummed into gauge links) are power-suppressed.
  \item \textbf{Gauge Invariance and Wilson Lines:} The definition of TMDs must include appropriate Wilson lines (gauge links) to ensure their gauge invariance. The specific path of these Wilson lines is process-dependent and reflects the color flow and the history of soft gluon interactions (initial-state or final-state interactions). For example, the Wilson lines for Drell-Yan TMD PDFs differ from those for SIDIS TMD PDFs due to the different final/initial state color environments.
  \item \textbf{Absence of Uncancelled Infrared Singularities in the Hard Part:} After factorization, the hard scattering part must be free of infrared (soft and collinear) singularities that are not absorbed into the TMDs. All such singularities associated with the external hadrons should be consistently factorized into the TMDs.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{How to Know if Factorization Applies to a Certain Process}

Determining whether TMD factorization applies to a specific process involves rigorous theoretical analysis within QCD:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Diagrammatic Analysis (Feynman Diagrams):} This is a cornerstone of factorization proofs. Physicists analyze the momentum regions of loop integrations in Feynman diagrams contributing to the process. They identify ``leading regions'' that give the dominant contributions in the kinematic regime of interest (e.g., $q_T^2 \ll Q^2$). The goal is to show that contributions from these regions can be systematically organized into a factorized form. This involves techniques like identifying pinch singularities and using Ward identities.
  \item \textbf{Effective Field Theories (EFTs):} Modern approaches often utilize EFTs like Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) or variations tailored for TMDs. In an EFT framework, one constructs an effective Lagrangian that describes the interactions of relevant degrees of freedom (e.g., soft, collinear, and hard modes) at the appropriate scales. Factorization then emerges more systematically from the structure of the effective theory and the decoupling of different modes.
  \item \textbf{Power Counting:} A crucial element is power counting in the small ratio $q_T/Q$ (or $\Lambda_{QCD}/Q$). One needs to demonstrate that the proposed factorized structure captures the leading-power terms in this expansion and that any deviations or additional terms are power-suppressed.
  \item \textbf{Universality Checks:} The TMDs defined within the factorization scheme for one process should, after accounting for the specific Wilson line structures, be applicable to other processes. Consistency across different processes is a strong check of the factorization framework.
  \item \textbf{Explicit Calculations:} Factorization theorems are often established and refined through explicit perturbative calculations at one or more loop orders. These calculations help to identify the structure of the hard functions, the evolution kernels for the TMDs, and any potential issues or subtleties.
\end{enumerate}

For a new process, establishing TMD factorization is a significant theoretical task. It involves showing that the cross-section can be written in the
desired convoluted form, identifying the correct operator definitions for the TMDs (including their gauge links), and demonstrating that the hard
coefficients are calculable and infrared safe. The Jefferson Lab PDF (qiu\_sidis\_tmd.txt, slides 23-25, 28-29) provides some insights into the
general arguments for factorization in Drell-Yan and SIDIS, emphasizing the suppression of quantum interference between short and long distances and
the role of long-lived parton states.

In summary, TMD factorization is a powerful tool, but its applicability is restricted to specific kinematic regimes and requires careful theoretical
justification based on the underlying dynamics of QCD.

\subsection{Criteria for Feynman Diagram Selection in TMD Studies}

The selection of relevant Feynman diagrams in the study of Transverse Momentum Distributions (TMDs) and related processes like SIDIS is guided by
several interconnected principles rooted in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and the specific theoretical framework being employed (e.g., TMD
factorization).

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{The Physical Process and Kinematic Regime:} The primary determinant is the physical process under investigation (e.g., SIDIS, Drell-Yan, $e^+e^-$ annihilation) and the specific kinematic regime. For TMD studies, one is typically interested in regimes where a hard scale $Q$ is much larger than the observed transverse momentum $q_T$ (i.e., $Q^2 \gg q_T^2$). Diagrams are selected based on their contribution in this limit. The leading-order diagrams provide the basic picture (e.g., the handbag diagram for SIDIS), while higher-order diagrams are needed for precision, to understand evolution, and to define TMDs consistently.

  \item \textbf{Power Counting and Leading Contributions:} In the context of factorization theorems, contributions to the cross-section are organized as an expansion in powers of $1/Q$ (or $q_T/Q$). Feynman diagrams are analyzed to identify those that give the ``leading power'' contributions. For TMD factorization, one seeks diagrams that contribute at the dominant power in the $q_T \ll Q$ limit. Diagrams yielding power-suppressed contributions are often neglected in a first approximation but become relevant for higher-twist studies or precision calculations.

  \item \textbf{Perturbative Order:} Calculations are performed to a certain order in the strong coupling constant, $\alpha_s$. Leading-order (LO) diagrams give the first non-trivial contribution. Next-to-leading order (NLO), next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO), etc., diagrams involve additional gluon emissions, virtual gluon loops, and quark loops. The choice of perturbative order depends on the desired accuracy of the theoretical prediction.

  \item \textbf{Structure of Factorization:} The diagrams must be consistent with the assumed factorization structure. For TMD factorization, this means identifying diagrams that can be separated into a hard scattering part, TMD parton distribution functions (PDFs), TMD fragmentation functions (FFs), and potentially a soft factor. Diagrams that connect these components in ways that cannot be factorized (e.g., ``Glauber gluons'' or ``Coulomb gluons'' that are not resummed into Wilson lines) might break factorization or are power-suppressed.

  \item \textbf{Gauge Invariance and Wilson Lines:} QCD is a gauge theory, and physical observables must be gauge invariant. The operator definitions of TMDs include Wilson lines (gauge links) to ensure this. Feynman diagrams are crucial for understanding the origin and structure of these Wilson lines. One considers diagrams with soft and collinear gluon exchanges between the active parton and spectator partons or the hard interaction. The resummation of these exchanges leads to the specific paths of the Wilson lines required for a gauge-invariant and process-independent (up to the Wilson line path) definition of TMDs.

  \item \textbf{Infrared Structure (Collinear and Soft Singularities):} Feynman diagrams in QCD often exhibit infrared (IR) singularities, which can be collinear (when a massless parton splits into two collinear massless partons) or soft (when a massless gluon with near-zero energy is emitted). Factorization theorems aim to show that these singularities can be systematically absorbed into the definition of universal non-perturbative functions like PDFs, FFs, or TMDs. Diagrams are analyzed for their IR singularity structure to ensure this cancellation and absorption mechanism works correctly.

  \item \textbf{Specific TMD Phenomena:} If one is interested in specific TMDs (e.g., Sivers function, Boer-Mulders function, Collins function), one focuses on diagrams that can generate the necessary spin-momentum correlations. This often involves considering diagrams with specific helicity structures for quarks and gluons and understanding how initial/final-state interactions (represented by the gauge links) contribute to these T-odd (time-reversal odd) TMDs.

  \item \textbf{Evolution Kernels:} To calculate the evolution of TMDs with the scales $\mu$ and $\zeta$, one needs to compute the anomalous dimensions and evolution kernels (e.g., the Collins-Soper kernel). This involves evaluating specific sets of Feynman diagrams (loop diagrams and real emission diagrams) that contribute to the scale dependence of the TMD operator matrix elements.
\end{enumerate}

In practice, this means that for SIDIS in the TMD regime, one starts with the LO handbag diagram. Then, to define and evolve TMDs, one considers
diagrams with additional gluon emissions from the initial-state quark (for TMD PDFs) or the final-state fragmenting quark (for TMD FFs), as well as
virtual corrections. The interactions of these gluons with the remnants or other parts of the process dictate the structure of the required Wilson
lines.

\subsection{The Concept of Twist in QCD}

The term ``twist'' in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a concept used to classify operators and their contributions to physical observables,
particularly in the context of the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) and deep inelastic scattering. It provides a way to organize contributions to
cross-sections in an expansion in powers of $1/Q$, where $Q$ is the large momentum scale characterizing the hard interaction.

\textbf{Definition of Twist:}

The twist, $\tau$, of an operator is conventionally defined as its **dimension minus its spin**:
\begin{equation}
  \tau = d - s
\end{equation}
where $d$ is the mass dimension of the local operator (or the dominant part of a non-local operator in certain contexts), and $s$ is its spin (more precisely, the maximum spin projection contributing).

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Dimension ($d$):} In natural units ($\hbar = c = 1$), mass and momentum have dimension 1, and length and time have dimension -1. Quark and gluon fields have mass dimension $3/2$ and $1$, respectively. Derivatives $\partial_\mu$ have dimension 1.
  \item \textbf{Spin ($s$):} This refers to the Lorentz spin of the operator. For example, a scalar operator has spin 0, a vector operator (like $\bar{\psi} \gamma^\mu \psi$) has spin 1, etc.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Significance of Twist:}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Power Counting in $1/Q$:} The contribution of an operator of a given twist $\tau$ to a hard scattering cross-section is typically suppressed by powers of $(1/Q)^{\tau - 2}$ relative to the leading twist-2 contribution. This means:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Leading Twist (Twist-2):} Operators with the lowest possible twist (which is $\tau=2$ for the most important operators in unpolarized and longitudinally polarized DIS) give the dominant contribution to the cross-section at very high $Q^2$. These are often associated with the simple parton model picture, where the struck parton is considered free and collinear with the parent hadron during the hard interaction. Collinear Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) like $f_1(x)$, $g_1(x)$, and $h_1(x)$ are defined from twist-2 operators.
          \item \textbf{Higher Twist (Twist-3, Twist-4, etc.):} Operators with $\tau > 2$ give contributions that are suppressed by powers of $M/Q$ or $\Lambda_{QCD}/Q$, where $M$ is a hadronic mass scale. These contributions represent more complex aspects of hadron structure, including quark-gluon correlations, multi-parton interactions, and effects of parton transverse momentum and finite size of the hadron. For example, twist-3 distributions often describe interference effects or involve an additional gluon field compared to their twist-2 counterparts.
        \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Parton Interpretation:} Twist-2 operators generally have the most straightforward interpretation in terms of the probability of finding a parton with a certain momentum fraction. Higher-twist operators involve more fields or derivatives, making their probabilistic interpretation less direct and often involving multi-parton correlations or interference terms.

  \item \textbf{Operator Product Expansion (OPE):} The concept of twist originates from the OPE, which is used to analyze the product of current operators at short distances (large $Q^2$). The OPE expresses this product as a sum of local operators multiplied by $Q$-dependent Wilson coefficients. The operators are organized by their twist, and the Wilson coefficients contain the $Q^2$ dependence. The hadronic matrix elements of these local operators are the parton distributions (or moments thereof).

  \item \textbf{Target Mass Corrections and Kinematic Higher Twist:} It is important to distinguish dynamical higher-twist effects (due to multi-parton correlations) from purely kinematic target mass corrections (TMCs), which are also suppressed by powers of $M^2/Q^2$ but arise from keeping the target mass finite in the kinematics.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Twist and TMDs:}

For Transverse Momentum Distributions (TMDs), the concept of twist is more nuanced than for collinear PDFs. While the operators defining TMDs are
constructed to capture leading-power behavior in the TMD factorization regime ($q_T \ll Q$), they inherently involve transverse momentum, which is
often associated with higher-twist effects in a purely collinear expansion.

Leading TMDs, such as the unpolarized TMD PDF $f_1(x, k_T^2)$ or the Sivers function $h_1^{\perp}(x, k_T^2)$, are considered ``leading twist'' within
the TMD framework. This means they contribute at the leading power in the $1/Q$ expansion when $q_T$ is kept as a separate small scale. However, if
one were to integrate these TMDs over $k_T$ to obtain collinear PDFs, or expand them for $k_T \sim Q$, their components might relate to operators of
different collinear twists.

The operators defining TMDs (like Equation~\ref{eq:tmd_definition}) are non-local and include Wilson lines. The ``dimension'' and ``spin'' for such
non-local operators are usually determined by focusing on the minimal number of fundamental fields and derivatives that carry the quantum numbers and
momentum fractions, effectively giving them a twist-2 like scaling in the TMD regime.

In summary, twist is a crucial organizational principle in QCD that classifies the importance of different operator contributions to hard scattering
processes based on their dimensionality and spin, directly relating to their suppression by powers of the hard scale $Q$. While leading TMDs are
considered twist-2 in their own factorization framework, their relation to the collinear twist classification can be more complex.

\subsection{Operators Defining Unpolarized TMDs and Their Origin}

The unpolarized Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Function (TMD PDF) for quarks, denoted as $f_1(x, k_T^2)$, quantifies the number
density of unpolarized quarks within an unpolarized hadron, carrying a longitudinal momentum fraction $x$ and transverse momentum $k_T$. Its
definition is rooted in the fundamental principles of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and involves a specific non-local quark-quark correlator.

\subsubsection{The Operator Definition for Unpolarized Quark TMD PDF}

The most common definition for the unpolarized quark TMD PDF, $f_1(x, k_T^2)$, is given by the trace of a quark correlator matrix $\Phi(x, k_T)$. The
correlator itself is defined as the Fourier transform of a non-local matrix element of quark fields within a hadron state $|P,S\rangle$ (where $P$ is
the hadron's momentum and $S$ its spin, though for unpolarized TMDs in an unpolarized hadron, spin averaging is implicit):

\begin{equation}
  \Phi_{ij}(x, k_T; n, P, S) = \int \frac{d\xi^{-} d^2\xi_T}{2(2\pi)^3} e^{i x P^{+} \xi^{-} - i k_T \cdot \xi_T} \langle P,S| \bar{\psi}_j(0) W(0, \xi; n) \psi_i(\xi) |P,S\rangle \Big|_{\xi^{+}=0, \xi \cdot P = \xi^- P^+}
  \label{eq:tmd_correlator_general}
\end{equation}

Here:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\psi_i(\xi)$ and $\bar{\psi}_j(0)$ are quark field operators with Dirac indices $i, j$ at spacetime positions $\xi$ and $0$, respectively.
  \item The hadron state $|P,S\rangle$ is normalized, e.g., $\langle P,S | P zephirprime, S zephirprime \rangle = (2\pi)^3 2P^+ \delta(P^+-P^{\prime+})
          \delta^{(2)}(P_T-P_T zephirprime) \delta_{SS zephirprime}$.
  \item $P^+$ is the large light-cone momentum component of the hadron ($P^+ = (P^0+P^3)/\sqrt{2}$ in a frame where $P$ moves along the $z$-axis).
  \item $\xi = (\xi^+, \xi^-, \xi_T)$ is the spacetime separation vector. The condition $\xi^+=0$ means the fields are separated at equal light-cone time. The condition $\xi \cdot P = \xi^- P^+$ is often used in light-cone gauge definitions.
  \item $W(0, \xi; n)$ is the Wilson line (or gauge link) connecting the points $0$ and $\xi$. It is a path-ordered exponential of the gluon field $A^\mu$: $W(0, \xi; n) = \mathcal{P} \exp\left(-ig \int_0^\xi dz_\mu A^\mu(z) \right)$. The path of the Wilson line is crucial for gauge invariance and depends on the process. For TMD PDFs relevant to SIDIS or Drell-Yan, the path typically involves staples extending to light-cone infinity ($n^-$ direction for SIDIS, $n^+$ for Drell-Yan, where $n$ is a light-like vector not proportional to $P$).
  \item $x$ is the longitudinal momentum fraction of the parton, and $k_T$ is its transverse momentum.
\end{itemize}

The unpolarized TMD PDF $f_1(x, k_T^2)$ is then obtained by taking a specific trace of this correlator matrix with the $\gamma^+$ Dirac matrix:
\begin{equation}
  f_1(x, k_T^2) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr} [\gamma^+ \Phi(x, k_T)] = \frac{1}{2} \int \frac{d\xi^{-} d^2\xi_T}{2(2\pi)^3} e^{i x P^{+} \xi^{-} - i k_T \cdot \xi_T} \langle P| \bar{\psi}(0) \gamma^+ W(0, \xi) \psi(\xi) |P\rangle \Big|_{\xi^{+}=0}
  \label{eq:f1_definition}
\end{equation}
(Here, spin averaging for the hadron state $|P\rangle$ is assumed, and Dirac indices are contracted in the trace.)

The $\gamma^+$ matrix projects out the ``good components" of the quark fields in a light-cone formalism, which have a direct interpretation as number
densities in the infinite momentum frame.

For gluons, a similar definition exists involving gluon field strength tensors $F^{\mu\nu}$ connected by Wilson lines in the adjoint representation.

\subsubsection{Origin of the TMD Operator Definition in QCD}

The operator structure for TMDs arises from the fundamental principles of QCD when attempting to describe the internal structure of hadrons in
processes where parton transverse momentum is resolved.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Parton Model and Probability Interpretation:} The starting point is the desire to generalize the parton model concept of PDFs. PDFs are interpreted as the probability of finding a parton with a certain longitudinal momentum fraction. TMDs extend this to include transverse momentum. In a quantum field theory, such probability densities are related to matrix elements of field operators.

  \item \textbf{Quark Number Density in Momentum Space:} The operator $\bar{\psi}(0) \gamma^+ \psi(\xi)$ (without the Wilson line for a moment) is related to the quark number operator. The $\gamma^+$ ensures one is counting partons with positive longitudinal momentum in a light-cone frame. The Fourier transform with respect to $\xi^-$ and $\xi_T$ translates the spatial separation into momentum components $xP^+$ and $k_T$.

  \item \textbf{Gauge Invariance and Wilson Lines:} QCD is a SU(3) gauge theory. Physical observables and well-defined parton distributions must be gauge invariant. The quark fields $\psi(\xi)$ and $\bar{\psi}(0)$ transform under local gauge transformations. A simple product $\bar{\psi}(0) \psi(\xi)$ is not gauge invariant if $0 \neq \xi$. To make the bilocal operator gauge invariant, a Wilson line (gauge link) $W(0, \xi)$ must be inserted between the fields. This Wilson line is a path-ordered exponential of the gluon field, $W(0, \xi) = \mathcal{P} \exp(-ig \int_0^\xi A_\mu dz^\mu)$, which transforms in such a way as to cancel the gauge transformations of the quark fields at points $0$ and $\xi$.

  \item \textbf{Process Dependence and Path of Wilson Lines:} The exact path of the Wilson line is not arbitrary and is determined by the process in which the TMD is being probed. It arises from resumming soft and collinear gluon exchanges between the active parton and the rest of the system (e.g., target remnants in SIDIS, or initial/final state interactions). For SIDIS TMD PDFs, the struck quark undergoes final-state interactions with the target remnants. These interactions are resummed into a future-pointing Wilson line staple. For Drell-Yan, initial-state interactions lead to past-pointing staples. This process dependence of the Wilson line path is what allows for non-zero T-odd TMDs like the Sivers function, which change sign between SIDIS and Drell-Yan.

  \item \textbf{Factorization from Cross Sections:} More formally, TMD operators emerge when applying QCD factorization theorems to scattering cross sections in the TMD regime ($q_T \ll Q$). By analyzing Feynman diagrams for processes like SIDIS, one can show that the cross-section separates into a hard, perturbatively calculable part and non-perturbative matrix elements that correspond precisely to the TMD operator definitions. The Wilson lines are essential for this factorization to hold, ensuring that the TMDs absorb all relevant long-distance collinear and soft gluon interactions associated with the hadron.

  \item \textbf{Light-Cone Quantization and Infinite Momentum Frame:} The use of light-cone coordinates ($\xi^+ = 0$) and the $\gamma^+$ projection is closely related to formulating QCD in light-cone quantization or viewing the process in an infinite momentum frame. In such frames, parton model ideas become more robust, and $x$ can be interpreted as the fraction of the hadron's large light-cone momentum.
\end{enumerate}

In essence, the operator definition of unpolarized TMDs (and polarized ones) is a carefully constructed object in QCD. It combines the idea of a
parton number density with the crucial requirement of gauge invariance, achieved through the inclusion of process-dependent Wilson lines. This
structure is validated by its emergence from factorization theorems, which connect these non-perturbative functions to measurable hadronic
cross-sections.

\subsection{Visualizing Wilson Lines in SIDIS}

Wilson lines (or gauge links) are fundamental to the definition of gauge-invariant Transverse Momentum Distributions (TMDs). They represent the
path-ordered exponential of the gluon field and effectively sum up the interactions of the active parton with soft and collinear gluons from the
hadronic environment. The specific path of the Wilson line is process-dependent and crucial for the properties of TMDs, including T-odd effects like
the Sivers function.

\subsubsection{The Structure of Wilson Lines for SIDIS TMD PDFs}

For a TMD Parton Distribution Function (PDF) relevant to Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS), the struck quark is taken out of the
initial-state nucleon. After being struck by the virtual photon, this quark propagates to the final state before fragmenting. During this
propagation, it can interact with the remnants of the nucleon through gluon exchanges. These are known as final-state interactions (FSIs).

To ensure gauge invariance of the TMD PDF operator, these FSIs are resummed into a Wilson line. For SIDIS TMD PDFs, the Wilson line typically has a
``staple'' structure that extends from the position of one quark field to light-cone infinity in a direction related to the hadron remnant's momentum
(usually denoted $n^-$ or a similar light-like vector), then transversely to another point at light-cone infinity, and then back to the position of
the other quark field. This is often called a ``future-pointing'' staple because it goes towards positive light-cone time for the final-state
interactions.

The operator for the quark TMD PDF (Equation~\ref{eq:tmd_correlator_general}) includes $W(0, \xi; n)$. For SIDIS, this $W(0, \xi; n)$ is constructed
as:
\begin{equation}
  W_{\text{SIDIS}}(0, \xi) = \mathcal{P} \exp\left(-ig \int_{\mathcal{C}[0, \xi]} A_\mu(z) dz^\mu \right)
\end{equation}
where the path $\mathcal{C}[0, \xi]$ is typically: $\xi \rightarrow \xi + \infty \cdot n^- \rightarrow 0 + \infty \cdot n^- \rightarrow 0$. The segments going to and from light-cone infinity ($n^-$ direction) are along the light cone, and the segment connecting them at infinity is a transverse link.

\textbf{Visualization Explanation:}

The diagram (to be provided as `sidis_wilson_line.tex`) aims to illustrate this concept:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Two points, $0$ and $\xi$, represent the locations of the $\bar{\psi}$ and $\psi$ fields in the TMD correlator. These points are separated by $\xi^-$
        in light-cone time and $\vec{\xi}_T$ in the transverse plane (at $\xi^+=0$).
  \item The Wilson line (shown conceptually, e.g., in green) starts at $\xi$, goes out to $+\infty$ along the $n^-$ light-cone direction (representing the
        propagation of the struck quark into the final state).
  \item It then traverses a link at this light-cone infinity, purely in the transverse direction, from a point aligned with $\xi$ to a point aligned with
        $0$.
  \item Finally, it returns from $+\infty$ along the $n^-$ light-cone direction to the point $0$.
\end{itemize}
This staple structure is essential for capturing effects like the Sivers function, which arises from the interference between different contributions involving these final-state interactions.

\textbf{Plane of Visualization:}

Wilson lines are paths in 4D spacetime. Visualizations are often projections:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A common way is to show the separation $(\xi^-, \vec{\xi}_T)$ in a plane, with the staple extending conceptually into/out of a third (light-cone)
        dimension and at light-cone infinity.
  \item The light-cone directions $n^+$ (related to the hadron's momentum $P$) and $n^-$ (related to the direction of the staple, often opposite to $P$ for
        SIDIS FSIs) define the longitudinal and light-cone time aspects.
  \item The transverse separation $\vec{\xi}_T$ lies in the plane perpendicular to the $P$ and $n^-$ directions (if they are not collinear, which they
        generally are not for staples).
\end{itemize}
The provided `sidis_wilson_line.tex` will offer a 2D conceptual representation of this 4D path, emphasizing the staple structure and its connection to the quark fields.

This structure is distinct from the Wilson line in Drell-Yan TMD PDFs, which involves past-pointing staples due to initial-state interactions,
leading to the famous sign flip of the Sivers function between SIDIS and Drell-Yan processes.
